STEP 1: Download and configuring Opensees
1. Checking out the prerequisites:
sudo apt-get install make tcl8.6 tcl8.6-dev gcc g++ gfortran python3-dev

2. Download OpenSees source from: https://github.com/eesd-epfl/OpenSees. Place it in /home/user_name ("Home" directory)

3. Create (if not existing yet) bin and lib folders in “home user” directory. Ex: /home/user_name/bin, /home/user_name/lib

4. Extract “OpenSees-master.zip” in “Home” directory and rename it to “OpenSees” 

5a. If using the tools only with external libraries, go to DEVELOPER and open Makefile, delete line 23 and save.
    Execute "make" in the DEVELOPER folder and copy the libraries in the element/cpp/Macroelement3d/Macroelement3d and material/cpp folders. Following steps are not necessary.
    Consider that section types cannot be used as external libraries. 

5. If instead all tools are needed, including section models (OrthotropicMembraneSection, NoTensionSection3d) the executable has to be rebuilt. 
   Go inside OpenSees source, in folder “MAKES” open “Makefile.def.EC2-UBUNTU” file.

6. Modify it to add the developer libraries to the compiled version:
   -  line 90: change path to "/usr/local"
   -  line 91: change path to "/home/user_name" (change user_name to the actual user name)
   -  add new line after line 103: "DEVdir       = $(HOME)/OpenSees/DEVELOPER"
   -  in what is now line 108, after "$(SRCdir)" add " $(DEVdir) "
   -  save file
   
7. Compiling: Open terminal being in "OpenSees” folder. Execute “cp ./MAKES/Makefile.def.EC2-UBUNTU ./Makefile.def”. Execute then “make”. 
   The libraries in the DEVELOPER folder will be linked to the main SRC code. It has to be used with the SRC folder from the repository https://github.com/eesd-epfl/OpenSees, which includes in section, element and material 
   Tcl commands the references to the added libraries (linked in SRC/Makefile.incl and added to the main FE library through in line 23 of the DEVELOPER Makefile)

8. After compiling, a binary file called “OpenSees” is created in “bin” folder (created in step 3).
